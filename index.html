									<h2>My experiences<a href="#">  <br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>My working career started when in 2018 with a cleaning business that my Mum gave me. I ran and operated that until 2022 when I passed it down to my sister. <br>
									I have been working as a surveyor since 2019 and have been at Webster Survey Group since January 2020. <br>
									I have had many experiences in both cadastral and construction surveying at Websters. <br>
									Listed below are some of the highlights of my career so far.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Asset Recording<br />
										Taylors Road, Plumpton</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Asset_Rec_Plumton.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This was a massive 3 stage subdivision for a new estate called Majesty along Taylors Road, Plumpton. I did the majority of the asset recording for this job.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Commercial Construction Setout<br />
										Taylor Avenue, Aspendale</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Setout_Aspendale.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I was part of a large commercial construction setout for 18 apartments right next to the beach in Aspendale. 
									Our team at Websters were on-site from the first setout up until the official subdivision of apartments.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Lot Pegging<br/>
										Pioneer Way, Gisborne</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Lot_Peg_Gisborne.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The new subdivisions along Pioneer Way in Gisborne required 15 lots to be pegged, flagged, and numbered. 
									This was my first time lot pegging, I have completed hundreds of other lot pegging at Websters since then.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Feature and Level Survey<br />
										Wiltshire Boulevard, Thornhill Park</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Feature_Thornhill.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This was a feature and level survey as well as a re-establishment survey. It was the first time that I was the lead surveyor with an assistant helping me. I have gained a lot more confidence in undertaking these as lead now.  </p>

										<h2><a href="#">House Setout<br />
										Swan Street, Eltham</a></h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Setout_34Swan.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This is possibly my favourite job of all. I have been able to apply everything that I have learnt and used it for my own purpose. This is my mums new house that she is building currently and I did the feature and level survey, marked boundaries, and completed the setout. </p>
